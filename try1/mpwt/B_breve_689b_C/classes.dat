UNIQUE-ID - Pseudo-Products
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class is a subclass of Frames because it does not make sense for it to be a subclass of anything else,
COMMENT - because Pseudo-Products do not actually exist.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Features
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
/optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
/points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.
/
/If there is a need to refer to two different states of a protein with a given feature (e.g. phosphorylated or
/unphosphorylated, metal-bound or not, crosslinked or not)  a Modified-Protein frame must be created
/that points back to the unmodified form.  Both forms of the protein point to the same feature, but the state
/annotation on the feature for each form indicates whether it is modified or not, or bound or not.  The state of a feature 
/can be left unspecified if it is not relevant to interactions of a particular protein form, and of course many 
/feature classes have no state.  The slot Possible-Feature-States indicates whether or not a feature class
/can have multiple states, and what those states are.
/
/For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
/can be phosphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
/states: MODIFIED (i.e. phosphorylated) and UNMODIFIED (i.e. unphosphorylated).   The feature instance
/itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
/represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
/creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
/FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
/instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
/to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
/annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote
/that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,
/whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.
/
/Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these
/features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,
/the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  
/
/For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented
/using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein
/the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 
/necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the
/protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the
/free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification
/case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need
/to be set for each form of the protein.

UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class record observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).

UNIQUE-ID - Generalized-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - All Pathways and Reactions
//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Ontology-Terms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Class Gene-Ontology-Terms is the root of the Gene Ontology (GO).  In a PGDB,
/gene products (including monomers, multimers, and chemically modified forms
/thereof) are assigned to GO terms in this hierarchy.  Note that a PGDB does not contain
/the entire GO ontology, it contains only those terms (and their parents) to which gene products have been
/assigned.  To browse the entire GO ontology, visit the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO website</a>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Evidence
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Evidence class defines a controlled vocabulary of evidence types.  Each term in the vocabulary 
/defines a type of evidence that pertains to an assertion in this database.  Example assertions include 
/the assertion that a pathway exists, or the assertion that an operon exists.  Example uses of the 
/evidence vocabulary are to record what type of evidence supports the assertion that an operon exists, 
/such as whether the evidence is based on a computational analysis or a wet-lab experiment, and if the 
/latter, what type of wet-lab experiment.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Enzymatic-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
/a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
/information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
/act as cofactors of the catalysis of that
/reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
/Enzymatic-Reactions also link via the Regulated-By slot to
/objects that define substrate-level regulation of this enzyme activity.
/It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
/enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
/and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EC-BOOKKEEPING
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This slot stores meta-information used to track changes to the EC taxonomy, e.g. deleted or merged EC numbers.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Databases
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Databases
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mixtures
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are used to define sets of compounds, or mixtures.
/Example uses include describing the biomass composition of an organism for the purpose
/of computational analysis, and describing growth media.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Collections
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - A group of frames, usually all of the same class, that are associated together in a single logical collection.  This is a utility class -- its only slot of its own is group-members.  Each of its subclasses will define a type of collection, and specify the class of frames that can be members.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Chemicals
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - a chemical
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical entity of some type, including
/elements, small molecular weight chemical compounds, and
/macromolecules.  This class does not include fragments of 
/molecules, such as regions within a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Cell-Types
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class is used to distinguish between different types of cells within a single organism.
//
UNIQUE-ID - CCO
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Cell Component Ontology
COMMENT - This class is the root of the Cell Component Ontology.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity 
/(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 
/or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 
/or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be
/some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that
/can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants
/and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 
/and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 
/generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 
/a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 
/potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 
/of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 
/some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of
/the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the
/activity of the enzyme.
/
/Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a
/process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organizations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an organization with which an author of
/information in a PGDB is associated.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - People
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class describes a person who has contributed information
/to a PGDB as a curator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organisms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Organisms class is used in different ways in organism-specific
/PGDBs versus in multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc.  The
/next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.
/Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.
/
/In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all
/possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between
/subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,
/since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the
/class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic
/groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 
/database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in
/addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 
/for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 
/
/Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only
/frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to
/describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.
/An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that
/describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 
/instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the
/organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and
/children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic
/parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.
/
/Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain
/no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 
/subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc
/(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 
/only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are
/stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 
/replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  
/Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.  
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Publications
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observation-Datasets
TYPES - Collections
//
UNIQUE-ID - Paralogous-Gene-Groups
TYPES - Collections
COMMENT - Each instance of this class describes a single group
/of paralogous genes.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Phenotype-Microarray-Plates
TYPES - Collections
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Reactions
TYPES - Regulation
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
/situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would
/be represented as follows:
/Regulator            = The small molecule
/Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity
/Mechanism          = Competitive
/Mode                  = +
/
/Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:
/Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.
/Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.
/Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.
/Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.
/Mixed               -- Mixed inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex, and decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.
/Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.
/Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.
/
/If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.

UNIQUE-ID - EV-ND
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - No biological data available
COMMENT - EV-ND is intended for use in GO annotations.
/
/Use of the EV-ND evidence code indicates that the annotator at the contributing database found no information
/that allowed making an annotation to any term indicating specific knowledge from the ontology in question
/(molecular function, biological process, or cellular component) as of the date indicated. This code should be used only
/for annotations to the root terms, molecular function ; GO:0003674, biological process ; GO:0008150, or cellular component ; GO:0005575,
/which, when used in annotations, indicate that no knowledge is available about a gene product in that aspect of GO.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by computational analysis
COMMENT - Inferred from computation.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a
/computational analysis.  The assertion itself might have been made
/by a person or by a computer, that is, EV-COMP does not specify whether
/manual interpretation of the computation occurred.
/

//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Author statement
COMMENT - Author statement.  The evidence for an assertion comes from an author
/statement in a publication, where that publication does not state direct experimental support
/for the assertion.  Ordinarily, this code will not be used directly -- generally one of
/its child codes, EV-TAS or EV-NAS, will be used instead.

UNIQUE-ID - Consensus-Growth-Results
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class do not represent primary growth observations.  Rather, if there are multiple conflicting growth observations for a particular medium/knockout, then an instance of this class can be used to represent the consensus view of what the correct growth-status result should be for those conditions.  Generally at most one instance of this class will exist for a given medium/knockout/temperature combination.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Conditions
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe the environmental conditions under which some set of data was collected.  These instances can be supplied as the value of the CONDITIONS
/annotation for environment-specific slots such as TRANSCRIPT-COPY-NUMBER.  The growth conditions that can be specified include temperature, pH, aerobicity, growth-media
/and gene knockouts (although the wildtype organism is assumed by default).  Any description of environmental conditions that cannot be captured via these slots should be
/described using the COMMENT slot. It is not necessary to specify a growth-status.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Primary-Growth-Observations
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class record primary observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts,
/as described in the primary literature.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).

COMMENT - This class describes compound mixtures whose constituents cannot be fully specified, such as various kinds of cell extracts that are used in rich growth media.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segment-Enzyme-Substrates
TYPES - Compounds
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMON-NAME - a polymer segment enzyme substrate
COMMENT - This class contains reaction substrates that stand for a segment or section of an extended polymer, like a nucleic acid.
/An enzyme might typically recognize a limited motif on the polymer, but the detailed sequence of the full length polymer will not matter in such reactions.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Media
TYPES - Compound-Mixtures
COMMENT - A growth medium is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/The set of compounds is listed in the COMPOSITION slot.
//
UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines segments within mRNA transcripts.  Although any given mRNA is a transcript of only
/a small portion of the replicon, for precision's sake, start and end locations of mRNA segments are defined relative to the start
/of the corresponding replicon, not relative to the start of the mRNA transcript.  This approach also
/allows us to avoid creation of frames for the transcripts themselves.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reactions
TYPES - Generalized-Reactions
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical transformation of some type.  It
/may involve small molecules or macromolecules.
/
//

COMMENT - Describes a feature that binds some other entity, such as a small molecule, site of some other protein, etc.
/Slot ATTACHED-GROUP specifies that entity.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Translation
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, translation of an mRNA transcript is regulated to activate or inhibit formation of the
/corresponding protein.  Relevant regulatory mechanisms include those that directly interfere with or facilitate the translation process,
/as well as those involving processing of the mRNA transcript to promote or inhibit its degradation before translation.

COMMENT - Biomass is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/It is a target set of compounds, usually representative of key intermediates in the metabolism.
/In computational analysis, one often assumes the cell is alive if all the compounds
/in the biomass set can be produced from the compounds in a growth medium.
/The biomass set of compounds is listed in the COMPOSITION slot.

SYNONYMS - GO:0044699
SYNONYMS - biological process
SYNONYMS - physiological process
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

TYPES - Gene-Ontology-Terms
COMMON-NAME - molecular_function
SYNONYMS - GO:0005554
SYNONYMS - molecular function
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

SYNONYMS - cellular component
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Describes a feature that is a contiguous linear region of an amino-acid chain.  
/The location of the region is specified using slots LEFT-END-POSITION
/and RIGHT-END-POSITION.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Amino-Acid-Sites
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Members of this class describe modifications to, binding to,or
/other interesting features of one or more specific (and generally 
/non-contiguous) amino acid residues in a polypeptide, as 
/opposed to a larger bounded region.  The set of residues
/defining the feature is encoded using slots RESIDUE-NUMBER
/(which lists the index within the amino-acid sequence of the
/indicated residue), and RESIDUE-TYPE (which lists the
/one-letter code of that residue).  The values of these two
/slots must be in parallel order.  The second slot is needed in
/cases where the full amino-acid sequence of the protein is not available.

COMMON-NAME - Biosynthesis
COMMENT - This class contains pathways that constitute a cell's complete spectrum of biosynthetic capacities, including the routes of synthesis of small molecules, macromolecules and cell structure components.
/When applicable, salvage pathways are included as well.  
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Activation/Inactivation/Interconversion
COMMENT - This class holds pathways for activation, inactivation, and interconversion of
/metabolic compounds.
/
/In contrast to a standard "biosynthesis" pathway in which a biologically active
/compound is synthesized from precursor molecules, activation pathways involve
/relatively minor chemical modifications to existing compounds that result in a
/substantial increase in their biological activity.
/
/Similarly, in contrast to standard "degradation" pathways in which a more complex
/compound is broken down into a set of simple metabolites, inactivation pathways
/involve relatively minor chemical modifications to existing biologically active
/compounds that result in a substantial decrease in their biological activity.
/
/
/Interconversion pathways describe the bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule
/to a different form. The forward and backward conversions often result in
/significant changes in the biological activity of the compound, thus resulting in its
/activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Energy-Metabolism
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy
COMMENT - This class contains the pathways of central metabolism (e.g. glycolytic, pentose phosphate, and TCA cycle pathways), which collectively produce the 13 starting materials, sometimes termed precursor metabolites, for all cellular biosyntheses. Other degradative pathways, sometimes termed feeder pathways, feed into central metabolism. This class also contains the pathways that generate energy under various conditions of growth.  
//
UNIQUE-ID - Degradation
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Degradation/Utilization/Assimilation
SYNONYMS - Assimilation
SYNONYMS - Utilization
COMMENT - This class contains pathways by which various organisms degrade substrates to serve as sources of nutrients and energy, utilize exogenous sources of essential metabolites, or assimilate certain sources of essential bioelements.   
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Detoxification
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Detoxification
COMMENT - This class contains pathways by which various organisms protect themselves 
/against the harmful effects of toxic compounds.
/The sole purpose of these pathways is to avoid toxicity, with no other 
/benefit (such as energy or useful metabolites) to the organism.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Bioluminescence

//
UNIQUE-ID - Metabolic-Clusters
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Metabolic Clusters
COMMENT - A metabolic cluster is a set of biochemical reactions that are biologically related, but are largely unconnected, 
/and therefore do not constitute a pathway in the traditional sense of the word.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMON-NAME - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.  
/Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 
/molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 
/way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 
/degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records
/the specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose

//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small regulatory RNA binds to a roughly complementary region on the mRNA transcript (specified
/in slot Associated-Binding-Site), possibly with the aid of one or more chaperones or accessory proteins (specified in slot
/Accessory-Proteins), to regulate translation.  Regulation may be by directly interfering with translation (for example,
/by directly blocking or by inducing some change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site), by
/causing (or preventing) the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, or by some combination of the two.  The Mechanism slot
/is used to indicate which of the above two mechanisms of action are involved, if known.  If a specific RNAse is specified
/in slot Associated-RNAse, then the sRNA targets the mRNA to be degraded by that particular RNAse.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript
/whose translation is being regulated.  The regulator will be an sRNA.

/abnormal situation prevails in a cell or organism).
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a regulatory protein activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA.   The protein can directly interfere with translation initiation
/by binding to the mRNA transcript (at a location recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) and either directly blocking the ribosome binding site, or
/by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation
/pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 
/translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 
/specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose 
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be a gene).  The regulator will be a protein.

/    <li> Functional complementation
/    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene
/</ul><p>
/This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence
/(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This
/category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done
/in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when

/be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 
/this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI
/than IMP annotations.)<p>
/
/IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative
/because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which
/may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>
/
/We have also decided to use this category for situations where a

//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Fragments
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMON-NAME - Gene-Fragments
COMMENT - This class is used when a single gene or pseudogene is made up of
/multiple fragments that are not adjacent on the chromosome.  Examples
/of when the use of gene-fragments is called for include a) when a
/pseudogene has been interrupted by one or more insertion elements so
/now comprises multiple non-contiguous segments, b) when a significant
/section of DNA (containing other genes) is excised before
/transcription, and a single transcript is produced from non-contiguous
/DNA segments, and c) to represent trans-splicing.  Gene fragment
/objects should NOT be created when a) a deletion results in a
/pseudogene that is nonfunctional because it is missing a portion of
/the gene, but still comprises a single segment (create this as a
/regular pseudogene instead), b) a gene product results from splicing
/together multiple exons within a single contiguous gene (use the
/CODING-SEGMENTS slot to represent that case instead), or c) when a
/gene or pseudogene contains an internal frame-shift or stop codon but
/still logically comprises a single contiguous extent of DNA.
/
/The sequence of a gene composed of Gene-Fragments is a concatenation
/of the sequences of all its fragments in the specified order (using
/their left-end-position and right-end-position slots, and
/reverse-complemented before concatenation if the gene is on the
/reverse strand). If a gene has Gene-Fragments, then the
/left-end-position and right-end-position slots of that gene must be
/empty.  Gene-Fragments cannot have Gene-Fragments of their own.  Each
/Gene-Fragment must have its own transcription-direction, in order to
/be able to represent cases of trans-splicing in which different
/fragments are on different strands.

UNIQUE-ID - Promoters
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe promoter regions.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcriptional-Attenuation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - This class describes the regulation of gene expression by transcription attenuation, or the premature termination of transcription.
/In all cases, the regulated-entity will be a terminator, although if precise terminator information is unknown then this frame may 
/alternatively be linked to a transcription-unit or gene.  When a terminator is specified, only genes in a transcription-unit that lie 
/downstream from the regulated terminator will have their expression regulated by instances of this class.
/
/Even though the regulated-entity may be a terminator, the value of the MODE slot refers to the overall effect on gene expression.
/Thus, a regulator that blocks termination at a terminator is considered an activator, and the value of the MODE slot will be "+",
/while a regulator that promotes termination is a repressor, with a value of "-" for the MODE slot.

UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Units
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines a transcription unit, meaning a set of one
/or more genes that are transcribed to produce a single messenger RNA.  
/The differences between a transcription unit and an operon
/are (1) Technically, an operon must include more than one gene.  
/(2) An operon may include more than one promoter.  For operons that
/include multiple promoters, a transcription unit is defined for each promoter.
/
/A transcription unit should have as its components one or more genes,
/zero or one promoter, and zero or more terminators.  Transcription factor binding sites
/need not be components of a transcription unit.  A one-to-one correspondence is
/defined between a transcription unit and a promoter plus set of genes.  Promoters can
/be omitted if the transcription start site is unknown, in which case the correspondence
/is between a transcription unit and a set of genes.  Multiple terminators can be included 
/in a transcription-unit, but typically a separate transcription unit is defined for each 
/different set of transcribed genes (an exception is made for attenuators --
/generally no transcription unit is defined for the truncated transcript produced by
/attenuation, even if it includes the gene for a leader peptide).

COMMENT - A motif of which seven or more may appear in a DNA-binding protein. Each is
/characterized by two closely spaced cysteine and two histidine residues that
/serve as ligands for a single Zn2+. When bound to Zn2+ they form a module
/from which protrude amino acid side chains that interact with the bases
/partially exposed to the DNA major groove. Since in the area of contact there is

/of the compound, thus resulting in its activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/Interconversion pathways are different from biosynthetic or degradative cyclic
/pathways in the fact that they lack an input and/or output flux. For example, the
/purpose of the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY "Calvin Cycle"|, which is a biosynthetic cycle, is CO<sub>2</sub>
/fixation. As the cycle turns there is a net input of carbon dioxide and net output
/of fructose 6-phosphate. In the interconversion pathway |FRAME:PWY-2345|, on
/the other hand, the purpose of the cycle is simply to convert the compounds
/genistein, genistin and malonylgenistin to each other in a reversible manner.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Respiration
TYPES - Energy-Metabolism
COMMENT - This class contains pathways of respiration by which various organisms generate,
/both aerobically and anaerobically, a trans-membrane ion gradient to serve as a
/source of energy.
/
/Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,
/|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,
/|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,
/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons across a membrane.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them
/on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one
/compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-7.1.2.2 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Factor-Binding
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation of transcription initiation whereby the binding of an RNA-polymerase to
/a transcription unit promoter is activated or inhibited by the binding of some entity (generally a transcription factor) to some nearby
/DNA binding site.  The regulator in this case is the transcription factor, and the regulated-entity is the transcription unit promoter
/(although what is really being regulated is the transcription of the transcription unit to produce RNA).  If no promoter has been identified
/for a transcription unit, or no transcription unit for a regulated gene, it is possible to specify the transcription unit or the gene itself as the 
/regulated-entity instead of the promoter, although it is understood that these cases describe incomplete information.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Allosteric-Regulation-of-RNAP
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation by an alarmone, which is produced by the cell under conditions of stress.  The alarmone
/binds to RNA-Polymerase, changing its promoter preference, and thus regulating transcription initiation.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ribosome-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the intracellular level of a charged tRNA determines whether or not the ribosome
/pauses while synthesizing a leader peptide.  The pause site consists of a series of one or more codons for a 
/particular amino acid.  The ribosome, which moves sequentially along the transcript, synthesizing protein, must 
/wait for a tRNA charged with that amino acid before it can proceed further.  Thus, the intracellular level
/of that amino acid determines how much charged tRNA is available, and therefore whether or not the 
/ribosome pauses.  The newly forming mRNA transcript can adopt one of two competing stem-loop conformations, a
/terminator or an antiterminator structure.  In all cases described so far, pausing favors the formation of
/an antiterminator structure, thus preventing terminator formation, and allowing gene expression.  The regulator
/in this case will be the particular charged tRNA, and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the attenuator consists of two competing stem-loop structures in the mRNA: an 
/antiterminator, which allows further transcription, and a terminator, which ends it.  An RNA pairs with a 
/region on the leader transcript to either stabilize or block the formation of an antiterminator, thus preventing 
/or allowing formation of the competing terminator, and consequently activating or inhibiting transcription.  
/Examples include the binding of an uncharged tRNA to a T box region on the leader transcript to stabilize an 
/antiterminator, or the pairing of an antisense RNA with its complementary strand to block antiterminator formation.  
/The regulator in these cases is an RNA and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Polymerase-Modification
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, a regulatory protein binds to a site in a transcription unit and interacts with
/RNA polymerase, such that the modified RNA polymerase is no longer sensitive to termination signals, 
/and transcription continues past one or more terminators.  The regulator is the regulatory protein and the 
/regulated-entity is a terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Rho-Blocking-Antitermination
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - Rho-dependent termination requires binding of the Rho hexamer upstream of terminator sites in a nascent transcript.
/In this class of attenuation, a regulator molecule causes the ribosome to stall adjacent to the Rho-factor
/binding site.  This prevents Rho from binding, thereby preventing Rho-dependent termination, and
/transcription continues.The regulator in this case is the regulator molecule, generally a protein, and the 
/regulated-entity is the Rho-dependent terminator.

HGI is also used for high throughput experiments that interrogate functional interactions between two or more genes or gene products when co-expressed, for example, in a cell line. Additional uses of HGI include high throughput experiments in which the expression of one gene affects the phenotypic outcome of a mutation in another gene.
/
/The HGI evidence code requires curators enter a stable database identifier for the interacting entity in the With/From field of the Gene Association File (GAF). Independent interactors may be captured in the With/From field by separating each entry with a pipe. If the interaction experiment involves multiple perturbations simultaneously, e.g. triply mutant strains, then the respective interactors are separated with a comma.

UNIQUE-ID - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the mRNA leader transcript can bind directly to small molecule ligands
/(the mRNA region in this case is also known as a riboswitch).  This binding determines which of two
/mutually exclusive RNA structures forms, a terminator or an antiterminator.  If the small molecule
/blocks antiterminator formation and thereby promotes terminator formation, it will inhibit transcription.  
/If it promotes antiterminator formation, it activates transcription beyond the terminator region.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, an RNA-binding protein will interact with the nascent transcript in order
/to determine which of two competing RNA stem-loop structures form: a terminator (thereby terminating transcription)
/or an antiterminator (thereby allowing transcription to continue).  When acting as an activator, the protein
/stabilizes the antiterminator, preventing terminator formation.  When acting as an inhibitor, the protein
/blocks antiterminator formation, allowing terminator formation.  The regulator in these cases is the
/RNA-binding protein and the regulated-entity is the terminator.

//
UNIQUE-ID - IS-Elements
TYPES - Transposons
SYNONYMS - Insertion Sequence Element
SYNONYMS - Insertion Sequence
COMMENT - An IS element is a short DNA sequence that acts as a transposable element, meaning
/it can change its position within the genome.  IS elements are small relative to other
/transposable elements, and they code only for proteins (e.g., transposases) involved in transposition
/activity.  When IS elements occur in the middle of genes, they interrupt the coding
/sequence and inactivate the gene.  IS elements can also block the expression of
/other genes within the same operon.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - REP-Elements
TYPES - Extragenic-Sites
COMMENT - A Repetitive Extragenic Palindrome (REP) element is a short base pair sequence capable of producing a stem-loop structure.  REP elements
/are located in different orientations and arrays between genes within an operon or at the end of an operon.  They are always found
/outside of structural genes.  Groups of REP elements are also known as BIMEs (bacterial-interspersed mosaic elements).  The actual function of these
/elements is unclear.  They may act as mRNA stabilizers, targets for DNA gyrase binding, or hot spots for transposition and recombination events.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Phage-Attachment-Sites
TYPES - Extragenic-Sites
COMMENT - Instances of this class are sites on the genome that are recognized by complementary sites on a phage, and are used by the phage to insert its DNA into the genome (lysogeny).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Origin-of-Replication
TYPES - Extragenic-Sites
COMMENT - The origin of replication is a particular sequence in the genome at which replication is initiated.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pathogenicity-Islands
TYPES - Genomic-Islands
COMMENT - Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are a class of genomic islands that are present in the genome of pathogenic microorganisms, but are usually absent from non-pathogenic
/organisms of the same or closely related species.  They contain genes that code for one or more virulence factors, such as adhesins, toxins, invasins, etc.  PAIs are discrete genetic units flanked by direct repeats, insertion sequences or tRNA genes, which are sites for recombination into the DNA.   They can be transferred as a single unit to new cells, thus conferring virulence to formerly benign strains.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Truncated-Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - The genes classified here have a truncated sequence, on the left or right side.
/This can occur at the ends of a contig.
/Because the full sequence is not known, no amino acid translation can be shown.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pseudo-Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - Pseudo genes are regions of DNA that show sequence similarity to other functional genes, but that
/are not in fact functional genes.   A pseudogene might be nonfunctional because of sequence
/changes that prevent its transcription or translation, such as by disrupting its promoter
/or by introducing a premature stop codon.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Phantom-Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - Phantom genes are regions of DNA that were once thought to be genes
/(such as because they were identified as genes by a computational
/gene-finding program), but that are not currently
/thought to be functional genes, for example because their expression has never
/been observed.  They are maintained in the database to maintain a
/record of their past versus current status.

UNIQUE-ID - ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION
TYPES - Respiration
COMMON-NAME - Anaerobic Respiration
COMMENT - Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,

/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons across a membrane.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them
/on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one
/compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-7.1.2.2 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.
/This class contains various pathways of anaerobic respiration.

UNIQUE-ID - Inactive-R-2-Hydroxyacyl-CoA-Dehydratase
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - an inactive (<i>R</i>)-2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase
COMMENT - Members of the (<i>R</i>)-2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase family are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive activator (component A) and a dehydratase (component D). Component A is a homodimer with one [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster bound in the dimer interface, while component D is a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe&ndash;4S] clusters and FMN. In order to catalyze the reaction, the dehydratase requires one high-energy electron that transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion, facilitating the elimination of the hydroxyl group. The electron needs to be supplied only once, before the first reaction takes place, since it is regenerated at the end of each reaction cycle. This initial activation is provided by the activator. 
/
/The activator, which has been named archerase because its open position resembles an archer shooting arrows, binds two ADP molecules. Upon the reduction of its [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster by a single electron, delivered by a dedicated flavodoxin, the two ADP molecules exchange for two ATP molecules, resulting in a large conformational change. The change results in the activator binding to the dehydratase component, upon which the two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed and the electron is transferred to the dehydratase, activating it |CITS: [15374661][18337824]|.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the oxidized [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster.

UNIQUE-ID - Flavodoxin
TYPES - Flavoproteins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12| |CITS: [11687213]|
/
/Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 
/
/Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. In many organisms, including cyanobacteria and anaerobes, Fld can substitute for Fd under conditions of iron deprivation.
/
/Please note that due to the limited ability to show protein structures, the structure shown here depicts only the FMN cofactor of flavodoxin.

UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Electron-Carriers
TYPES - Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a redox electron carrier
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-Quinones
TYPES - Aromatics
COMMON-NAME - a quinol
SYNONYMS - quinol
SYNONYMS - a hydroquinone
SYNONYMS - a reduced quinone
COMMENT - A quinol, or hydroquinone, is the fully reduced form of |FRAME: Quinones|.
/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Half-Reactions
TYPES - Simple-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Redox Half-Reactions
COMMENT - Redox half reactions are elementary reactions, in which explicitly
/stated electrons are reducing an oxidized molecular species.  These
/reactions do not stand alone, because electrons do not occur freely.
/Instead, a half reaction must be paired with another half reaction to
/form a complete, overall transformation.
/
/The convention adopted here is to write the half reactions always in
/the same direction, namely in the form:
/
/Ox. + e- --> Red.
/
/In other words, the oxidized species and the electrons are always in
/the LEFT slot, and the reduced species are always in the RIGHT slot.
/
/This reaction direction allows the standard reduction potential to be
/directly recorded in the STD-REDUCTION-POTENTIAL slot, such that
/reactions of this type are comparable with each other.

UNIQUE-ID - All-tRNAs
TYPES - ssRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a tRNA
SYNONYMS - a transfer RNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the 2' or 3' terminal OH of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).
/
/This class encompasses both charged and uncharged tRNA molecules.

UNIQUE-ID - Composite-Reactions
TYPES - Chemical-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Composite Reactions
COMMENT - A composite reaction R is represented both as a net chemical
/transformation, and a set of sub-reactions of which R is comprised.
/Those sub-reactions represent finer grained details of the reaction.
/Thus, composite reactions may have their mechanistic details recorded,
/when such information is available.  The relationships among the
/sub-reactions are stored in the same way as are the relationships of
/reactions within a pathway (i.e. using the Reaction-List/In-Pathway and 
/Predecessors slots).  As a result, composite reactions exhibit
/hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and
/externally, they look like reactions.
/
/The LEFT and RIGHT slots of composite reactions reflect the overall
/inputs and outputs of the composite transformation.  At a later point
/in time, these slots should be automatically kept in synch with the
/sub-reactions.  However, currently the Reaction Editor will have the
/burden of updating the LEFT and RIGHT slots.
/
/An enzyme that is linked to a composite reaction may or may not also
/be linked to its sub-reactions -- cases when we might not want to link
/the enzyme to sub-reactions might be if one or more sub-reactions are
/spontaneous (so the enzyme would only be linked to the non-spontaneous
/sub-reactions), or if the enzyme were a complex with each of its subunits
/catalyzing a different sub-reaction (in which case it should be the subunit
/that is linked to each corresponding sub-reaction, not the complex).

COMMENT - Thioredoxin is a small electron-transfer protein that contains a cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site in the form of C-X-X-C.  It functions in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxin is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates.
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-flavodoxins
TYPES - Flavodoxin
COMMON-NAME - a reduced flavodoxin
SYNONYMS - a dihydroflavidoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12| |CITS: [11687213]|
/
/Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 
/
/Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. In many organisms, including cyanobacteria and anaerobes, Fld can substitute for Fd under conditions of iron deprivation.
/
/Please note that due to the limited ability to show protein structures, the structure shown here depicts only the FMN cofactor of flavodoxin.

COMMON-NAME - a U6 snRNA
SYNONYMS - a U6 spliceosomal RNA
COMMENT - U6 snRNA is a non-coding  (|FRAME: snRNAs "small nuclear RNA"|) that forms an RNA-protein complex known as the U6 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) complex. 
/
/This complex, in turn, combines with other snRNPs, unmodified pre-mRNA, and various other proteins to assemble a spliceosome, a large RNA-protein molecular complex that removes introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA. U6 is one of five snRNPs that are found in the spliceosome |CITS: [3041282]|.
/
/Base-pair specificity of the U6 snRNA allows the U6 snRNP to bind tightly to the U4 snRNA and loosely to the U5 snRNA  during the initial phase of the splicing reaction |CITS: [7882985]|. During the reaction cycle the U6 snRNA dissociates from U4 and binds to the U2 snRNA |CITS: [8299941]|. It is also associated with the 5' end of the intron that is being cleaved.

TYPES - All-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - an uncharged tRNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/This class encompasses uncharged tRNA molecules. The structure shown here depicts the CCA nucleotides at the 3' end of an uncharged tRNA.

COMMENT - EntF is a four-domain protein that contains an N-terminal elongation/condensation domain, an adenylation domain, a peptidyl-carrier protein domain, and a C-terminal thioesterase domain |CITS: [10688898]|. It is part of the enterobactin synthase complex.
/
/<i>Holo</i>-EntF contains a covalently bound 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety that is attached posttranslationally by the EntD  enzyme to a serine side chain in the peptidyl-carrier domain. The enzyme activates L-serine through an ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction at the carboxylate group of L-serine, then transfers the seryl-moiety to its peptidyl-carrier domain, where it remains bound for further reactions |CITS: [3040679][1826089][1338974][8939709][9025288][22365602]|.
/
/The other substrate for EntF is |FRAME: 23DHB-EntB|, which if formed by the EntE-catalyzed acylation of the |FRAME: Holo-EntB "<i>holo</i>-EntB protein"| with |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE|.

COMMENT - EntB is a bifunctional enzyme that is involved in the |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN| biosynthesis pathway. Enterobactin, a siderophore molecule, is synthesized in response to iron deprivation by formation of an amide bond between |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| (2,3-DHB) and |FRAME: SER|.
/
/EntB is a bifunctional protein that consists of an N-terminal isochorismatase domain and a C-terminal aryl-carrier protein (ArCP) domain |CITS: [9214294]|. The isochorismatase domain catalyzes the synthesis of |FRAME: DIHYDRO-DIOH-BENZOATE| from |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE| (|FRAME: EC-3.3.2.1|).
/
/The <i>apo</i>-ArCP domain first undergoes phosphopantetheinylation catalyzed by EntD, turning EntB into the active <i>holo</i>-EntB. The active domain then serves as a substrate for EntE, which activates |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| (formed from |FRAME: DIHYDRO-DIOH-BENZOATE| by EntA) and attaches it to the ArCP domain of EntB |CITS: [9485415][9214294]|.

COMMON-NAME - a quinone
SYNONYMS - quinone
COMMENT - Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins
TYPES - Ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. 
/
/In plant and mammalian type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that are present in motifs with the pattern -C-X<sub>4,5</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>n</sub>-C-, with n=&tilde;30.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

UNIQUE-ID - Electron-Transfer-Reactions
TYPES - Composite-Reactions
COMMENT - Electron transfer reactions (ETRs) describe reactions that transfer
/electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox
/processes that oxidize and reduce some of the substrates.  ETRs
/usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to
/use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the
/membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,
/using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often
/involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can
/shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.
/
/All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two
/redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit
/electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to
/be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only
/internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible
/as substrates of the ETR.
/
/Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of
/the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the
/vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using
/energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport
/reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the
/pathway representation of the composite reaction.
/
/Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in
/the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment
/information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception
/to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always
/assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

UNIQUE-ID - Charged-tRNAs
TYPES - Modified-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a charged tRNA
SYNONYMS - an aminoacyl-tRNA
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

UNIQUE-ID - tRNA-Sec

SYNONYMS - a tRNA(Sec)
SYNONYMS - a tRNA<sup>[Ser]Sec</sup>
COMMENT - tRNA(sec) is a special tRNA that inserts selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons.
/
/tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis. There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA template.
/
/tRNA(sec) can insert selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons |CITS: [3033637]|. The ability of tRNA(sec) to insert selenocysteine appears to depend on the specific sequence and folding of a stem-loop 3' to the insertion site |CITS: [1834670][1396569]|. tRNA(sec) has poor affinity for the normal elongation factor EF-Tu, instead binding to the specialized |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| |CITS: [2408012][2531290]|. The aminoacyl acceptor helix of tRNA(sec) promotes binding to |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| and prevents binding to EF-Tu |CITS: [1939093][2524495]|. 
/
/Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|. tRNA(sec) is charged in a two-step process, being aminoacylated with L-serine by |FRAME: SERS-CPLX|, then having that associated amino acid converted to selenocysteine by |FRAME: CPLX0-1141|, as shown in |FRAME: PWY0-901| |CITS: [2963963][1839607]|. Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.
/
/tRNA(sec) varies in areas that are otherwise invariant across most tRNAs |CITS: [2963963][2529478]|. Many of these differences act to prevent incorrect addition of selenocysteine at random UGA stop codons |CITS: [1370545]|. tRNA(sec) has an unusual acceptor stem consisting of eight, rather than seven base pairs, which is required for proper function |CITS: [1702199]|. 
/
/The solution structure of tRNA(sec) has been chemically evaluated |CITS: [8510147]|.

UNIQUE-ID - GLX-tRNAs
TYPES - tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a tRNA<sup>Glx</sup>
COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>glx</SUP> is a class consisting of two |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNAs| - |FRAME: GLN-tRNAs|, which binds |FRAME: GLN|, and |FRAME: GLT-tRNAs|, which binds |FRAME: GLT|. The need for such a class arises from the existence of enzymes that can accept both tRNAs (see |FRAME: EC-6.1.1.24|).
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

COMMON-NAME - an L-cysteinyl-[tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>]
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-prolyl group bound to the terminal 3'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562| and yeast |CITS: [17206069]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-methionyl group bound to the terminal 2'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562| and yeast |CITS: [17206069]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the 2' or 3' terminal OH of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).
